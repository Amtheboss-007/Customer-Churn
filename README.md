## ðŸ§  Key DAX Measures

```dax
Churn Rate (%) = 
DIVIDE(
    [Churned Customers],
    [Total Customers],
    0
) * 100

Joins Per Month = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT(Customer_Churn_Dataset[CustomerID]),
    USERELATIONSHIP(Customer_Churn_Dataset[JoinDate], DateTable[Date])
)

Churns Per Month = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT(Customer_Churn_Dataset[CustomerID]),
    Customer_Churn_Dataset[Status] = "Churned",
    USERELATIONSHIP(Customer_Churn_Dataset[EndDate], DateTable[Date])
)
